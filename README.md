# Here are the steps to make it work.

# Firstly you need a discord bot that's the "Alpha", it could be any bot, if You don't have a discord bot create one!

# After you're done creating the bots, copy their tokens and save it in a file.
# Then create a server, and copy the channel id of any channel you'd like to chat in, you must have developer mode on before you can do that.

# Modify the file "Bot(alpha).py", fill in the required details, eg : the bot token and the channel id.
# Send the bot.py to the person you'd like to chat with, and inform them to fill in with their bot token(make sure both bots are in the same server).
# Install the required modules...

# Copy the unique base64 key and send it to your friend, make sure it's transferred vocally or in a really secure way.
# Then ask them to run the bot.py with their specific bot token and the "-k" flag to specify the unique base64 key.
